    "title": "Scenario 1: "Smart Factory" Real-Time Monitoring",
    "question": " I haven't enabled encryption on these local files to keep the CPU overhead low on the gateways."

Architect's Pitch to the ARB:
"The main goal here is speed and visibility. We can have this live in two weeks. It bypasses the need for complex firewall rules because we're using the existing corporate Wi-Fi, and the vendor's cloud platform handles all the heavy lifting for the analytics. We’re ready to go live on Monday."",
    "answer": "The management interface should not be internet-facing and must be protected with strong authentication, network segmentation, and access controls. Questions should focus on admin access paths, MFA, logging, and isolation from production workloads."

    "title": "Scenario 2: Flat Network Architecture",
    "question": "All application tiers (web, app, database) are deployed in the same network segment with unrestricted east-west traffic. What risks does this create?",
    "answer": "This enables lateral movement in case of compromise. Review should question network segmentation, zero-trust principles, and micro-segmentation controls."
