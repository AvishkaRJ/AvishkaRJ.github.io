    <h2>Practice Through Scenarios</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      This platform is designed to sharpen your cyber security architecture review skills through realistic,
      design-level scenarios. Each scenario contains intentional weaknesses, missing controls, or risky design
      decisions. Your goal is to identify the flaws and think about the critical questions that must be asked
      before approving the architecture.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      Train yourself to think like a security architect: challenge assumptions, assess risks early, and ensure
      systems are secure by design, not by accident.
